<p>Let &#xB5; be a finitely additive probability measure on &#x3C9; which vanishes on points, that is, &#xB5;({<span style="font-style:italic">n</span>})=0 for every <span style="font-style:italic">n</span>&#x2208;&#x3C9;. It follows immediately that &#xB5; is not &#x3C3;-additive, however it may be almost &#x3C3;-additive in the following weak sense. We say that &#xB5; is a <span style="font-style:italic">P-measure</span> if for every decreasing sequence (<span style="font-style:italic">A</span><sub><span style="font-style:italic">n</span></sub>) of subsets of &#x3C9; there is a subset <span style="font-style:italic">A</span> such that <span style="font-style:italic">A</span>&#x2216; <span style="font-style:italic">A</span><sub><span style="font-style:italic">n</span></sub> is finite for every <span style="font-style:italic">n</span> and &#xB5;(<span style="font-style:italic">A</span>)=lim<sub><span style="font-style:italic">n</span></sub> &#xB5;(<span style="font-style:italic">A</span><sub><span style="font-style:italic">n</span></sub>). P-measures can be thought of as generalizations of P-points and similarly as in the case of P-points the existence of P-measures is independent of ZFC.</p><p>During my talk I will discuss basic properties of P-measures and show, at least briefly, that using old ideas of Solovay and Kunen one can obtain a non-atomic P-measure in the random model. The latter result implies that in this model &#x3C9;<sup>*</sup> contains a closed nowhere dense ccc P-set, which may be treated as a (weak) partial answer to the open question asking whether there are P-points in the random model.<br>
