<p>Set theory in the form of Zermelo-Fraenkel&#x2019;s axiomatic set theory is
usually considered the standard foundation of Mathematics. Type Theory
which is based on the static notion of types is an alternative offers
many advantages: the notion of a type seems to be closer to
mathematical practice, types hides implementation details which
enables Voevodky&#x2019;s univalence principle, and it is supported by a
number of implementations providing the base for formal developments.</p><!--CUT END -->
