<p><span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">Sealing</span></span> is a generic absoluteness principle for the theory of the universally Baire sets of reals introduced by Woodin. It is deeply connected to the Inner Model Program and plays a prominent role in recent advances in inner model theory. Woodin showed in his famous Sealing Theorem that in the presence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">Sealing</span></span> holds after collapsing a supercompact cardinal. I will outline the importance of <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">Sealing</span></span> and discuss a new and stationary-tower-free proof of Woodin&#x2019;s Sealing Theorem that is based on Sargsyan&#x2019;s and Trang&#x2019;s proof of <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">Sealing</span></span> from iterability. This is joint work with Grigor Sargsyan and Bartosz Wcis&#x13A;o.</p><!--CUT END -->
