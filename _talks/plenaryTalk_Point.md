<p>A. Tarski, A. Robinson and A. Macintyre have described languages for which real-closed fields, algebraically closed valued fields, p-adically closed fieds admit quantifier elimination (and as a consequence one has a good understanding of definable sets in these structures). In particular, these structures are respectively o-minimal, C-minimal, p-minimal (more generally of dp-rank 1). More recently one has described satisfactory languages for which the corresponding theories admit elimination of imaginaries. 
In his work on Shelah&#x2019;s conjecture on fields with the non independence property (NIP), W. Johnson has shown that a field of dp-rank 1, which is not strongly minimal can be endowed with a definable field topology. 
</p><p>Differential expansions of (topological) fields of characteristic 0, where there is a priori no interactions between the derivation and the topology, have been first considered by M. Singer in the case of real-closed fields and he showed that the theory of differential ordered fields has a model companion. 
This was later generalized by M. Tressl in the class of large fields (a class of fields introduced by F. Pop). 
</p><p>In this talk, we consider the following setting.
Given a large field of characteristic 0 endowed with a definable field topology and its theory <span style="font-style:italic">T</span>, we denote by <span style="font-style:italic">T</span><sub>&#x3B4;</sub> the theory of differential expansions of models of <span style="font-style:italic">T</span> by a derivation &#x3B4; (satisfying the usual axiom: &#x3B4;(<span style="font-style:italic">x</span>+<span style="font-style:italic">y</span>)=&#x3B4;(<span style="font-style:italic">x</span>)+&#x3B4;(<span style="font-style:italic">y</span>)&#x2227; &#x3B4;(<span style="font-style:italic">xy</span>)=&#x3B4;(<span style="font-style:italic">x</span>)<span style="font-style:italic">y</span>+<span style="font-style:italic">x</span>&#x3B4;(<span style="font-style:italic">y</span>)). 
Under some further conditions on definable subsets in models of <span style="font-style:italic">T</span>, we show the following.
The class of existentially closed models of <span style="font-style:italic">T</span><sub>&#x3B4;</sub> is first-order axiomatisable by a theory <span style="font-style:italic">T</span><sub>&#x3B4;</sub><sup>*</sup>. Properties such as: quantifier elimination, the NIP property, elimination of imaginaries transfer from <span style="font-style:italic">T</span> to <span style="font-style:italic">T</span><sub>&#x3B4;</sub><sup>*</sup>. In order to show the last result, we first prove a cell decomposition theorem for models of <span style="font-style:italic">T</span>, applying a similar strategy as for topological fields of dp-rank 1 due to P. Simon and E. Walsberg and then we show that there are no new open definable sets in models of <span style="font-style:italic">T</span><sub>&#x3B4;</sub><sup>*</sup>.
This approach can be applied to certain theories of pairs of models of <span style="font-style:italic">T</span>.
These results were obtained in collaboration with N. Guzy and P. Cubides Kovacsics.
</p><p>Then, using that the theories <span style="font-style:italic">T</span> we consider, are geometric theories (the topological dimension is well-behaved), 
we pursue our analysis to describe finite-dimensional definable groups in models of <span style="font-style:italic">T</span><sub>&#x3B4;</sub><sup>*</sup>. We relate them to definable groups in models of <span style="font-style:italic">T</span>, using Weil&#x2019;s approach to recover an algebraic group from generic data.
This last part is ongoing work with A. Pillay and K. Peterzil.
