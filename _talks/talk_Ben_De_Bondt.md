<p>For the purpose of this abstract, let &#x201C;a Namba-type forcing&#x201D; be any forcing that forces &#x3C9;<sub>2</sub> to get cofinality &#x3C9; and doesn&#x2019;t collapse &#x3C9;<sub>1</sub>.It is well known that the existence of a semiproper Namba-type forcing is equivalent to a Strong Chang&#x2019;s Conjecture, but that instead the existence of a stationary set preserving Namba-type forcing is provable in plain <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">ZFC</span></span>. However, in the context of questions on iterated-forcing-using-side-conditions, it is natural to ask whether one can demand more than mere stationary set preservation and get provably in <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">ZFC</span></span> a Namba-type forcing that allows many (but not necessarily club many) models for which there exist sufficient semi-generic conditions.In this talk I will discuss a &#x201C;side-condition version&#x201D; &#x2119; of Namba forcing and explain that there exists a very natural projective stationary family of countable elementary submodels of <span style="font-style:italic">H</span><sub>&#x3B8;</sub> such that &#x2119; is semiproper <em>with respect to these models</em>. In fact, we can consider a notion of strong semiproperness, in analogy to the notion of strong properness and verify that &#x2119; satisfies it, again with respect to these distinguished models.As an application of this approach towards Namba forcing, we discuss a particularly natural presentation of an &#x201C;ersatz iterated Namba forcing&#x201D; which, given an increasing sequence (&#x3BA;<sub>&#x3B1;</sub>: &#x3B1; &lt; &#x3B3;) of regular cardinals &#x2265; &#x3C9;<sub>2</sub>, adds for every &#x3B1; &lt; &#x3B3; a countable cofinal subset of &#x3BA;<sub>&#x3B1;</sub>, while at the same time preserving stationarity of stationary subsets of&#xA0;&#x3C9;<sub>1</sub>. In the proof, we will make strong use of a technique involving labelled trees and games played on such trees that appears in [<a href="#cite1">1</a>].Finally, we will mention closely related ongoing work and remaining questions.<br>
This talk is based on joint work with my thesis supervisor Boban Veli&#x10D;kovi&#x107;.</p><!--TOC section id="sec1" References-->
