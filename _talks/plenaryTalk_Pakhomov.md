<p>The celebrated Gödel&#x2019;s second incompleteness theorem is the result that roughly speaking says that no strong enough consistent theory could prove its own consistency. In this talk I will first give an overview of the current state of research on the limits of applicability of the theorem. And second I will present two recent results: first is due to me [<a href="#Pak19">1</a>] and the second is due to Albert Visser and me [<a href="#PV21">2</a>]. The first result is an example of a weak natural theory that proves the arithmetization of its own consistency. The second result is a general theorem with the flavor of Second Incompleteness Theorem that is applicable to arbitrary weak first-order theories rather than to extension of some base system. Namely the theorem states that no finitely axiomatizable first-order theory one-dimensionally interprets its own extension by predicative comprehension.</p><!--TOC section id="sec1" References-->
