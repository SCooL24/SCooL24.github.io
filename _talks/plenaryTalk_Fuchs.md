<p>Classically, a set is ordinal definable if it is the unique object satisfying a formula with ordinal parameters. Generalizing this concept, given a cardinal &#x3BA;, I call a set &lt;&#x3BA;-blurrily definable if it is one of less than &#x3BA; many objects satisfying a formula with ordinal parameters (called a &lt;&#x3BA;-blurry definition). By considering the hereditary versions of this notion, one arrives at a hierarchy of inner models, one for each cardinal &#x3BA;: the collection of all hereditarily &lt;&#x3BA;-blurrily ordinal definable sets, which I call &lt;&#x3BA;-HOD. In a ZFC-model, this hierarchy spans the entire spectrum from HOD to V. </p><p>The special cases &#x3BA;=&#x3C9; and &#x3BA;=&#x3C9;<sub>1</sub> have been previously considered, but no systematic study of the general setting has been done, it seems. One main aspect of the study is the notion of a leap, that is, a cardinal at which a new object becomes hereditarily blurrily definable. The talk splits into two parts: first, the ZFC-provable properties of blurry HOD, which are surprisingly rich, and second, the effects of forcing on the structure of blurry HOD and the achievable leap constellations.
