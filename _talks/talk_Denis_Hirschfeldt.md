<p>Mycielski&#x2019;s Theorem is a Ramsey-theoretic result on the reals withversions for measure and for category. These imply respectively thatthere is a perfect tree whose paths are all relatively 1-random, andthat there is a perfect tree whose paths are all relatively1-generic. In fact, in relativized form, the latter two statementsare equivalent to the two versions of Mycielski&#x2019;s Theorem. I willdiscuss joint work with Carl G. Jockusch, Jr. and Paul E. Schupp onthe computability-theoretic and reverse-mathematical strength of thesestatements.</p><!--CUT END -->
