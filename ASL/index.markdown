Students that are ASL members may apply for ASL travel support for any or all events in the context of SCooL 2024. 

Applications and recommendations for any of the events must be received before the **19th of March**. No late applications will be accepted. Decisions will be communicated before the 19th of April.

To apply, email the required application materials to the ASL office at [asl@uconn.edu](mailto:asl@uconn.edu) with “ASL travel application” in the subject line.

**Required application materials for a student travel award:**
1. Send a brief (preferably one page) letter of application that includes:
* Your name
* Your home institution
* Your thesis supervisor’s name
* A one-paragraph description of your studies and work in logic
* A paragraph indicating why it is important to attend the meeting
* Your estimate of the travel expenses you will incur
* For citizens or residents of the USA: citizenship or Visa status
* Optional: an indication of your gender and minority status.
  
2. Ask your thesis supervisor to send a brief recommendation letter. *_Please note that if your advisor does not send this directly to the ASL office (i.e. you send it yourself), we will ask for a confirmation email from your advisor to confirm that the letter did in fact come from them.*_
