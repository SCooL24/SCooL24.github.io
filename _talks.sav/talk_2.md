<p>We investigate a non-classical version of linear temporal
logic (with next &#x2218;, eventually &#x22C4;, and henceforth &#x25A1; modalities) whose propositional fragment is G&#xF6;del&#x2013;Dummett logic
(which is well known both as a superintuitionistic logic and
a t-norm fuzzy logic). The importance of both linear temporal logic and of fuzzy logics in computer science is well established. </p><p>We define the logic using two natural
semantics&#x2014;a real-valued semantics and a semantics where truth values are captured by a linear Kripke frame&#x2014;and can show that these indeed define one and the same
logic. Although this G&#xF6;del temporal logic does not have any
form of the finite model property for these two semantics, we are able to prove decidability of the validity problem. The proof makes use of <em>quasimodels</em> [<a href="#cite1">1</a>], which are a variation on Kripke models where time can be nondeterministic. We can show that every falsifiable formula is falsifiable on a finite
quasimodel, which yields decidability. We then
strengthen this result to PSPACE-complete. Further, we provide a deductive calculus for G&#xF6;del temporal logic with a finite number of axioms and deduction rules, and can show this calculus to be sound and
complete for the above-mentioned semantics.</p><!--TOC section id="sec1" References-->
