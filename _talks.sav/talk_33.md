Dissatisfaction with the philosophical thought of L.&#xA0;E.&#xA0;J. Brouwer has led to a growing interest over the last few decades in the
support of his intuitionism from a phenomenological approach, building on ideas from Husserl. The main supporters of this interpretation are Richard Tieszen and Mark van Atten. It is rooted in Heyting&#x2019;s idea that a proposition is an intention which is fulfilled with a proof-object of it. </p><p>In this talk I argue against this propositions-as-intentions interpretation. I must stress at the outset that the interpretation is already a target of harsh criticisms regarding the incompatibility of Brouwer&#x2019;s and Husserl&#x2019;s positions, mainly from Guillermo Rosado Haddock or Claire Hill. But their objection consists in denying the interpretation its major premise. 
This is not the direction I wish to take in this talk. Instead, I object that even if we grant that the incompatibility can be properly dealt with, as van Atten believes it can, one fundamental issues remain: it is far from clear what the object of an intention corresponding to a proposition should be. I argue that Heyting&#x2019;s own suggestion is inadequate and the most plausible candidates for intentional objects are sets of canonical proof-objects of the propositions. But this thesis immediately leads us to a difficult fulfillment dilemma: for Husserl, an intention is fulfilled when the intended object is genuinely presented to us in just the way it is intended; but here only one element of the set, not the set itself, can fulfill the intention. I conclude that the propositions-as-intentions leads to undesirable consequences.
