## Twelfth Scandinavian Logic Symposium (SLSS 2024) ##

### 14–16 June 2024, Reykjavík, Iceland ###

The twelfth Scandinavian Logic Symposium (SLSS 2024) will be held at Reykjavik University, Iceland, during 14-16 June, 2024, under the auspices of the [Scandinavian Logic Society](https://scandinavianlogic.org/). The previous four meetings of the SLSS were held in [Bergen](https://scandinavianlogic2020.w.uib.no/eleventh-scandinavian-logic-symposium-slss-2020/) in Norway (2022), [Gothenburg](https://scandinavianlogic.org/2017-09-18-SLS2018.html) in Sweden (2018), [Tampere](https://homepages.tuni.fi/kerkko.luosto/event/SLS2014/) in Finland (2014), and [Roskilde](http://scandinavianlogic.weebly.com/) in Denmark (2012).

The primary aim of the Symposium is to promote research in the field of logic (broadly conceived) carried out in research communities in Scandinavia. Moreover, it warmly invites the participation of logicians from all over the world. The meeting will include invited lectures and a forum for participants to present contributed talks.
