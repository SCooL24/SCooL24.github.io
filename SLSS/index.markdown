## Twelfth Scandinavian Logic Symposium (SLSS 2024) ##

### 14–16 June 2024, Reykjavík, Iceland ###

The twelfth Scandinavian Logic Symposium (SLSS 2024) will be held at Reykjavik University, Iceland, during 14-16 June, 2024, under the auspices of the [Scandinavian Logic Society](https://scandinavianlogic.org/). The previous four meetings of the SLSS were held in [Bergen](https://scandinavianlogic2020.w.uib.no/eleventh-scandinavian-logic-symposium-slss-2020/) in Norway (2022), [Gothenburg](https://scandinavianlogic.org/2017-09-18-SLS2018.html) in Sweden (2018), [Tampere](https://homepages.tuni.fi/kerkko.luosto/event/SLS2014/) in Finland (2014), and [Roskilde](http://scandinavianlogic.weebly.com/) in Denmark (2012).

The primary aim of the Symposium is to promote research in the field of logic (broadly conceived) carried out in research communities in Scandinavia. Moreover, it warmly invites the participation of logicians from all over the world. The meeting will include invited lectures and a forum for participants to present contributed talks.

**Suggested topics**  
The scope of SLSS is broad, ranging over the whole areas of Mathematical and Philosophical Logic, as well as Logical Methods in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics, among others. Major topics include (but are not limited to)
* Proof Theory
* Constructivism
* Model Theory
* Set Theory
* Computability Theory
* Algebra and Logic
* Categorical Logic
* Modal and Temporal Logics
* Dynamic Logics
* Logic and Computer Science
* Logic in AI and Multi-Agent Systems
* Logic and Linguistics
* Philosophical Logic
* Philosophy of Logic, Mathematics and Computation

Title: Causal models and their generalizations

Abstract: The Structural Equation models considered in the field of causal inference describe causation in terms of functions that relate the behaviour of different magnitudes (variables). Galles and Pearl (1997) observed that the same framework supports a notion of (interventionist) counterfactual that differs from those offered by the philosophical literature, and to which many notions of causation can be reduced.

I will give an overview of the logic literature on interventionist counterfactuals, starting with the classical results in the context of standard causal models. Next, I will point to some causality-related issues that are not represented in causal models, such as the interaction of observations and interventions, and the possibility of assuming indeterministic causal laws; and make a case that appropriate generalizations of team semantics and possible-world semantics may be good candidates for extending the formalization of causal discourse.

Title: Second order well-behaved

Abstract: Second-order logic extends the expressive power of first-order logic, allowing for the representation of properties that involve quantification over all subsets or families of subsets within a given structure, addressing a fundamental need in mathematical discourse. However, while offering significant advantages, full second-order logic faces challenges due to its impredicative nature and the absence of crucial metalogical properties, which complicates the development of proof systems. Our research tackles these challenges by introducing G3-style sequent calculi that incorporate a predicative comprehension schema, facilitating constructive cut-elimination proofs.  
Expanding upon these calculi, we delve into the proof theory of mathematical theories, adapting methods from first-order calculi and establishing structural results for both classical and intuitionistic versions of the calculi. Additionally, we define extensional equality and apartness within second-order logic, demonstrating the ability to reduce mathematical concepts to pure logical terms. To illustrate, we present the theories of von Neumann–G¨odel–Bernays set theory and predicative second-order arithmetic. Moreover, we establish a variant of Herbrand’s theorem tailored for predicative second-order intuitionistic logic, demonstrating the conservativity of predicative second-order Heyting arithmetic over its first-order counterpart. Furthermore, we extend the interpolation theorem and modal embedding of intuitionistic logic to predicative second-order logic.
