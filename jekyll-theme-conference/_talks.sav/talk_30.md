<p>We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, 
i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. 
Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) <span style="font-weight:bold">NL</span>, rather than <span style="font-weight:bold">P</span> or <span style="font-weight:bold">NC</span><sup>1</sup>, respectively.</p><p>The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">eLNDT</span></span>.
Our system <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">eLNDT</span></span><sup>+</sup> is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the &#x2018;monotone sequent calculus&#x2019; <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">MLK</span></span> is obtained from the usual sequent calculus <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">LK</span></span> by restricting to negation-free formulas.</p><p>Our main result is that <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">eLNDT</span></span><sup>+</sup> polynomially simulates <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">eLNDT</span></span> over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">MLK</span></span> by Atserias, Galesi and Pudl&#xE1;k, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works 
of Je&#x159;&#xE1;bek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Kouck&#xFD;.
Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><span style="font-style:italic">eLNDT</span></span><sup>+</sup> by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.
