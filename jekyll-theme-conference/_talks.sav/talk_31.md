<p>Trust is a very critical and yet one of the least understood processes in the computing paradigm. As opposed to typical case studies based on toy examples, we demonstrate how we leverage formal verification to understand the complicated notion of trust in the real-world settings, with a specific focus on remote attestation in confidential computing. In this talk, we present the challenges and lessons learnt in the formal specification and verification of Intel&#x2019;s next generation architecture named Intel Trust Domain Extensions, and demonstrate how we ended up making Intel update the specification. </p><p>The proposed talk will specifically address the following questions:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
What is confidential computing? How does it compare with the existing state-of-the-art technologies, such as Homomorphic Encryption? 
</li><li class="li-itemize">Why remote attestation is critical in confidential computing?
</li><li class="li-itemize">What were the challenges in the formal specification of remote attestation in Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and the upcoming Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX)?
</li><li class="li-itemize">How we drive formal methods to practice for the automated verification of security properties of remote attestation protocols in Intel SGX and TDX? 
</li><li class="li-itemize">What are interesting open challenges of relevance for logic community for formal verification of remote attestation in confidential computing?
