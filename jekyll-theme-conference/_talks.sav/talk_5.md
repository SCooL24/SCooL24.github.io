<p>In first-order logic, the following formulations of the compactness theorem can be easily proved from one another:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Every set of sentences that is finitely satisfiable is satisfiable</em>;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Every set of formulas that is finitely satisfiable is satisfiable</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For dependence logic, the first version of compactness is a well-known result and was proved by Väänänen in <span class="citation" data-cites="cite1"></span> using the translation between dependence logic and <span class="math inline"><em>Σ</em><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup></span>. However, in the context of dependence logic, one cannot derive (ii) from (i) by replacing variables with constants, as it is the case for first order logic.</p>
<p>The second version of compactness (ii) has been recently considered by Kontinen and Yang in <span class="citation" data-cites="cite3"></span>, who used the translation from dependence logic to <span class="math inline"><em>Σ</em><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup></span> to show that “<em>every set of formulas with countably many free variables that is finitely satisfiable is satisfiable</em>". In our talk, we provide a proof of the second version of compactness (ii) for arbitrary sets of formulas by adapting ultraproducts to the context of team semantics.</p>
<p>Finally, we briefly touch upon the issue of types in dependence logic, and we see how to obtain a compact space of suitable type.</p>
