<p>A complete theory is said to be categorical, if it has a unique model up to isomorphism. Due to the upwards and downwards L&#xF6;wenheim-Skolem theorems, complete first-order theories with infinite models are never categorical, as they have models in all infinite cardinalities. In contrast, the second-order versions of many familiar theories (such as second-order Peano Arithmetic, or the second-order theory of the real numbers as a complete ordered field) are categorical. One therefore wonders about the extent of this phenomenon: given an arbitrary complete second-order theory, is it categorical? As non-categorical complete second-order theories exist by a cardinality argument, it is reasonable to require that the theory is tractable in some sense (such as finitely axiomatizable, recursively axiomatizable, or that it has a model of size &#x3BA; for some particular cardinal &#x3BA;). It turns out that for many classes of theories, the answer is independent of ZFC.</p><p>In this talk we present some new results in this area.
