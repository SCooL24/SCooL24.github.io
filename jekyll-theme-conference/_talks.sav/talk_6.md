<p>In this paper we study frame definability in finitely-valued modal logics and establish two main results via suitable translations: (1) in finitely-valued modal logics one cannot define more classes of frames than are already definable in classical modal logic (cf. <span class="citation" data-cites="tho"></span>), and (2) a large family of finitely-valued modal logics define exactly the same classes of frames as classical modal logic (including modal logics based on finite Heyting and MV-algebras). In this way one may observe, for example, that the celebrated Goldblatt–Thomason theorem applies immediately to these logics. In particular, we obtain the central result from <span class="citation" data-cites="te"></span> with a much simpler proof and answer one of the open questions left in that paper. Moreover, the proposed translations allow us to determine the computational complexity of a big class of finitely-valued modal logics. Finally, we show that the first translation we offer (from finitely-valued modal logic into two-valued modal logic) yields a 0-1 law over models for the former (cf. <span class="citation" data-cites="kapron1"></span>) as a corollary of W. Oberschelp’s generalization <span class="citation" data-cites="ober"></span> of Fagin’s 0-1 law. In particular, one can show that, over Kripke models for finitely-valued modal logics based on finite frames, for every modal formula there is a truth-value that it takes almost surely at all worlds.</p>
