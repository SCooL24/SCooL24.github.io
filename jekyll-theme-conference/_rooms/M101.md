M101 is the main room, where plenary talks will take place. Social events (welcome reception and dinner) are also mentioned here, so as not to clutter the presentation of the schedule. Click on the event to know where it actually takes place.

Room M101 is located on the first floor of the Mars area. When entering the university, you are in the Sun. Go left to reach the Mars/Venus aisle, and immediately take the door to the right to reach M101.
