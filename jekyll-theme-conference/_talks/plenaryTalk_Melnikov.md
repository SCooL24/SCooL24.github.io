In my talk I will discuss the current state of the rapidly developing filed of &#x2018;primitive recursive&#x2019; mathematics. The subject has many different aspects. The main motivation of this framework is to understand the role of unbounded search in computable mathematics: either eliminate it when possible, or prove that without the unbounded search the result fails.
Also, primitive recursion serves as a &#x2018;bridge&#x2019; between the more abstract Turing computable mathematics and the perhaps more applicable polynomial-time and automatic algebra and analysis.

 Over that past several years, investigations into this direction have uncovered many deep technical issues and results that were completely &#x2018;invisible&#x2019; in the more general  Turing computable algebra, analysis, and infinite combinatorics. Some recent results of this sort simply have no direct analogy in computable structure theory.
In my talk I will emphasise those results and research directions in primitive recursive mathematics that either lead to counter-intuitive results or give new insights into other branches of effective mathematics. In particular, connections  with automatic structure theory  and reverse mathematics will be mentioned.
