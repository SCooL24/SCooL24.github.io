<p>Elementary patterns of resemblance are ordinal notations that can be approached from both a combinatorial
and a semantic angle. The former derives from the observation that patterns are so-called respecting forests,
while the latter is tied to the existence of unique isominimal realizations in the ordinals when interpreting the edges of
patterns by elementary substructurehood. For patterns of order 1 the characterization of isominimal realizations is
quite perspicuous, whereas patterns of order 2 already pose challenges, some of which I will address in my talk.</p><!--CUT END -->
