<p>The practice of foundations of mathematics is built around a firm distinction between syntax and semantics. But how stable is this distinction, and is it always the case that semantically presented mathematical objects, in the form e.g. of a model class, might give rise to a &#x201C;natural logic" in which the model class is definable? Can a logic without a syntax be considered a logic at all? In this talk I will investigate different scenarios from set theory and model theory in which an investigation of the notion of an implicit or internal logic or syntax becomes possible. I will close by discussing some historical issues raised by Blanchette [<a href="#paddy">1</a>], Goldfarb [<a href="#goldfarb">2</a>] and others having to do with the relation between having a precise syntax and the development of metamathematics, in early foundational practice.</p><!--TOC section id="sec1" References-->
