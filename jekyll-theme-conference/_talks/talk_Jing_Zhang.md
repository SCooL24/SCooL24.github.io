<p>It is a well-known theorem by Shelah that for any infinite cardinal &#x3BB;&gt;&#x2135;<sub>0</sub>, 2<sup>&#x3BB;</sup>=&#x3BB;<sup>+</sup> is equivalent to &#x2666;(&#x3BB;<sup>+</sup>). However, the situation at inaccessible cardinals is different. Woodin produced a model where the diamond principle fails at a (greatly) Mahlo cardinal, based on the analysis of the Radin forcing. We will discuss the advantage and the limitation of such method. Furthermore, we demonstrate a new method giving rise to the failure of the diamond principle at an inaccessible cardinal, fundamentally different from Woodin&#x2019;s method. The differences from the previous method will be highlighted. Joint work with Omer Ben-Neria.</p><!--CUT END -->
