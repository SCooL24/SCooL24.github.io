<p>The iterative notion of set starts with a simple, coherent story, and yields a paradise of mathematical objects, which &#x201C;provides a court of final appeal for questions of mathematical existence and proof&#x201D; ([<a href="#Maddy%3ANM">5</a>, p.26]). But it does not present an attractive mathematical ontology: it seems daft to say that every mathematical object is &#x201C;really&#x201D; some (pure) set. My goal, in this paper, is to explain how we can inhabit the set-theorist&#x2019;s paradise of <em>mathematical objects</em> whilst remaining <em>ontologically neutral</em>. </p><p>I start by considering stories with this shape: (1) Gizmos are found in stages; every gizmo is found at some stage. (2) Each gizmo reifies (some fixed number of) relations (or functions) which are defined only over earlier-found gizmos. (3) Every gizmo has (exactly one) colour; same-coloured gizmos reify relations in the same way; same-coloured gizmos are identical iff they reify the same relations.</p><p>Such a story can be told about (iterative) sets: they are monochromatic gizmos which reify one-place properties. But we can also tell such stories about gizmos other than sets. By tidying up the general idea of such stories, I arrive at the notion of a MOON theory (for Mathematical Objects with Ontological Neutrality). </p><p>With weak assumptions, I obtain a metatheorem: <em>all MOON theories are synonymous</em>. Consequently, they are (all) synonymous with a theory which articulates the iterative notion of set (LT<sub>+</sub>; see [<a href="#Button%3ALT1">1</a>]). So: all MOON theories (can) deliver the set-theorist&#x2019;s paradise of mathematical objects. But, since different MOON theories have different (apparent) ontologies, we attain ontological neutrality. </p><p>My metatheorem generalizes some of my work on Level Theory ([<a href="#Button%3ALT1">1</a>], [<a href="#Button%3ALT2">2</a>], [<a href="#Button%3ALT3">3</a>]). It also delivers a partial realization of Conway&#x2019;s &#x201C;Mathematician&#x2019;s Liberation Movement&#x201D; [<a href="#Conway%3AONG">4</a>, p.66]. </p><!--TOC section id="sec1" References-->
